    An HTML eleme is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, 
    one of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).
    [vague] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there 
    have since been many versions of HTML. The most commonly used version is HTML 4.01,
     which became official standard in December 1999.[1] An HTML document is composed 
     of a tree of simple <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"><b>Google</b></a> HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add 
     semantics and formatting to parts of document (e.g., make text bold, organize it
      into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element
       can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other 
       elements and text.
